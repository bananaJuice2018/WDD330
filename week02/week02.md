## Javascript

### HTML Button onclick -Javascript
The `onclick` event executes a certain functionality when a button is clicked. 

```javascript
<button onclick="functionToExecute()">Click</button>

functionToExecute(){
    // Doing something after Click.
}

```

#### Declare variables `let`, `const`, `var`.

Use `const` to declare the variables instead of `let` and `var`, because with const, things are safer as the variable becomes read-only.


#### Button Change Color Project. The DOMâ€™s getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and the querySelector() methods.

The `querySelector()` method returns the first element that matches a CSS selector. Use `querySelector()` becasue it is more modern and it's faster.

```javascript
<p class="name">Writing something</p>
const name = document.querySelector(".name").style.color = "red"; // If its class, use the . to access.

<p id="name">Writing something</p>
const name = document.querySelector("#demo").style.color = "red"; // If its id, use the # to access.

```
